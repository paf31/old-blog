A Lemma on Fixed Points
I was reading some of my older notes on least fixed point types and found this. It's hardly groundbreaking I'm sure you'll agree, but I thought it was quite a nice little result.

Lemma

Suppose

F : (X, Y) -> (F_1 X, F_2 (X, Y))

is a functor with an initial algebra. Then the initial algebra is isomorphic to

mu(F) ~ (mu(F_1), mu(\X -> F_2(mu(F_1), X)))

when all defined terms exist.

Example

Let F (X, Y) = (1 + X, 1 + X * Y).

By the lemma we have

Mu F = (Mu \X.(1 + X), Mu \Y.(1 + Y * Mu \X. (1 + X)))
That is, Mu F = (Nat, List Nat).

Proof

We show that the term on the right of the isomorphism relation is an initial F-algebra. Then, by uniqueness, it must be isomorphic to Mu F.

Let

Chi(X) = F_2(mu(F_1), X)

First we show that (Mu F_1, Mu Chi) is an F-algebra. The algebra morphism is

\begin{aligned}
F\left(\mu F_{1}, \mu \chi\right) &=\left(F_{1} \mu F_{1}, F_{2}\left(\mu F_{1}, \mu \chi\right)\right) \\
&=\left(F_{1} \mu F_{1}, \chi(\mu \chi)\right) \\
& \rightarrow \quad\left(\mu F_{1}, \mu \chi\right)
\end{aligned}

where the two components of the final map are the initial algebra morphisms for Mu F_1 and Chi.

It is required to prove that (Mu F_1, Mu Chi) is an initial algebra, that is, for any F algebra F A -> A, there is a unique morphism of algebras (Mu F_1, Mu Chi) -> A.

We seek morphisms

mu(F_1) -> pi_1(A)
mu(Chi) -> pi_2(A)

such that the following diagrams commute:

\begin{array}{c}
F_{1} \mu F_{1} \\
\mid \text { out } \\
\mu F_{1}
\end{array} \longrightarrow \quad \begin{array}{c}
F_{1} \pi_{1} A \\
\phi \\
\pi_{1} A
\end{array}

\begin{array}{ll}
\chi \mu \chi & \longrightarrow & \chi \pi_{2} A \\
\mid \text {out} & \\
\mu \chi & \longrightarrow & \pi_{2} A
\end{array}

The first morphism is determined uniquely by the definition of Mu F_1.

We just need to show that pi_2 A is a Chi-algebra. Then, the second morphism is given uniquely by the definition of Mu Chi.

We have morphisms

\begin{array}{ccccc}
f & : & \mu F_{1} & \rightarrow & \pi_{1} A \\
\pi_{2} a & : & F_{2}\left(\pi_{1} A, \pi_{2} A\right) & \rightarrow & \pi_{2} A
\end{array}

which compose to give

\begin{aligned}
\chi \pi_{2} A &=F_{2}\left(\mu F_{1}, \pi_{2} A\right) \\
& \rightarrow F_{2}\left(\pi_{1} A, \pi_{2} A\right) \\
& \rightarrow \quad \pi_{2} A
\end{aligned}

ï»¿This completes the proof.
